<br>
The Myer Briggs and Big 5 Personality tests confirmed what I have always known that I am introverted. In particular, I scored 13 on Extraversion in the Big 5 and 82% Introvert
on the Myer Briggs Test. The Learning style test also confirmed that I am a visual learner. However, I don't agree with the aspects of my personality that have been derived 
from these tests. For example, I only scored a 52 in Agreeableness and I have always seen myself as someone that is very co-operative. The tests also determined that I tend to 
be a traditionalist and not open to new experiences. While that is true right now, it's quite difficult to try new things in lockdown.
<br>
<br>
The tests determined that I am an introvert and generally don't feel comfortable in a big crowd. However, the tests seem to be referring to face-to-face interactions and 
think I would definitely be comfortable with working with a team online. I may rely on visual aids to effectively collaborate with a team. Because I tend to 'go-with-flow' 
I think it's highly likely that I will agree with the decisions of the collective group.
<br>
<br>
Despite my easy going nature, that doesn't mean I should be forming a random team. The Myer-Briggs Test showed that I have a Turbulent Architect . Turbulent architects 
don't abide by traditions and subject everything to intense scrutiny. They tend to be independent and free from the expectations of others. This allows them to pursue 
their own interesting and fresh ideas.
<br>
<br>
Thus, it would be wise to work with people that dre open to new and innovative ideas. Most importantly though, I should choose team members that I am confident will be 
easy to communicate with and will do their fair share of the work
<br>
<br>
Overall, the test results show that while I tend to pursue new and innovative ideas alone, I tend to blindly agree with decisions when in a group. It's imperative that I 
express my ideas more readily to the group.
