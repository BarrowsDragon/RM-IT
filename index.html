 <p style="font-size:30px; color:blue">Why i'm interested in IT</p>
I have always been interested in computers since childhood and I have been amazed with the rapid advances in technology throughout my lifetime. I think there are exciting 
opportunities in IT in the future and I would love to be a part of it. I chose to study with RMIT because it is a local university and has an excellent technology program. 
I hope to have a thorough understanding of all things IT throughout this course. I am thinking of a career in either data science or machine learning.
