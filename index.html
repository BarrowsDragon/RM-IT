<li style="font-size:30px; color:red">Why i'm interested in IT</li>
<p>I have always been interested in computers since childhood and I have been amazed with the rapid advances in technology throughout my lifetime. I think there are exciting 
opportunities in IT in the future and I would love to be a part of it. I chose to study with RMIT because it is a local university and has an excellent technology program. 
I hope to have a thorough understanding of all things IT throughout this course. I am thinking of a career in either data science or machine learning.   </p>

This is an advert for a Anti-cheating specialist position at gaming company Jagex. This position is appealing to me for 2 reasons. Firstly, it is for a game I actively play
and enjoy, Old School Runescape. Second, I have always been fascinated with bots and how they are detected. I would be tasked with combating macroers and dealing with other 
    threats to the game such as Real World Trading and Scamming.</p>

The postion lists a series of skills, both essential or desired that are needed for the position. These include;

    <ul><li>Automous working in a cross functional team</li>
      <li>Strong understanding of gaming communities and culture</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication</li>
<li>Familiar with SQL with a desire to learn other languages such as Python or other scripting languages</li>
      <li>Avid Runescape or Old School Runescape player</li>
    </ul>

<li>Out of these skills I would say the only one I have great expertise in is being an avid Old School Runescape player where I am near maxed combat.<li>

    <b><li>Automous working in a cross functional team</li></b>
Collabortative group work throughout this course
    <br>
    
<br>
    <b>Strong understanding of gaming communities and culture</b>
    <br>
I have a strong understanding of the Runescape community but I could try comparing it with the other gaming communities out there
<br>
    <br>
    <b>Excellent verbal and written communication</b>
    <br>
This should naturally develop as a progress in this course
<br>
    <br>
<b>Familiar with SQL with a desire to learn other languages such as Python or other scripting languages</b>
    <br>
    I hope I can have strong profiency in this with the attainment of an IT degree</p>
